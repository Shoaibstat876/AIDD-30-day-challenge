⭐ 1. What is SPECKit Plus? – Short Note
SPECKit Plus is a structured development framework that teaches how to think, plan, and execute software projects using a clear, repeatable pattern. It divides the entire engineering process into five phases:
1.	Constitution – Define the purpose, identity, and boundaries of the project.
2.	Specify – Convert the vision into detailed requirements.
3.	Plan – Create a roadmap of the entire system.
4.	Tasks – Break the roadmap into small, actionable tasks.
5.	Implement – Build features step-by-step according to the plan.
This framework ensures clarity, reduces errors, improves teamwork, and provides professional structure before writing a single line of code. It is widely used in real-world AI and software engineering.

⭐ 2. Short Answers for the 5 Core Concepts
Below are clear, concise, and professional short answers for each SPECKit concept, exactly as required.
________________________________________
1)	Constitution Phase — Short Answer
The Constitution Phase establishes the foundation of the project.
Here we define:
•	Project vision and mission
•	Core problem being solved
•	Target users
•	Boundaries and limitations
•	Success criteria
It ensures everyone understands what is being built and why.
This phase gives the project its identity, direction, and purpose.

2️) Specify Phase — Short Answer
The Specify Phase converts the vision into precise requirements.
Here we document:
•	User stories
•	Functional requirements
•	Non-functional requirements
•	Inputs, outputs, and acceptance rules
The goal is zero ambiguity.
Everyone should know exactly what the system must do before coding starts.

3️) Plan Phase — Short Answer
The Plan Phase transforms requirements into a step-by-step execution plan.
This includes:
•	System architecture
•	Feature breakdown
•	Technology choices
•	Component grouping
•	Development roadmap
It ensures the entire project is predictable and easy to manage.
This phase answers how the project will be built.
________________________________________
4️) Tasks Phase — Short Answer
The Tasks Phase breaks the project into small, clear tasks.
Each task includes:
•	Objective
•	Steps
•	Acceptance criteria
•	Expected output
This phase creates an actionable to-do list for developers.
It helps track progress and ensures teams work in sync.
________________________________________
5️) Implement Phase — Short Answer
The Implement Phase is where actual coding begins.
Developers follow the tasks and build:
•	Features
•	APIs
•	UI components
•	Agent logic
•	Integrations
The focus is on writing clean, structured, and testable code that strictly follows previous specifications.
This phase converts all planning into a working product.
